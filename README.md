# Gradient Component Editor

A component-wise gradient editor that works in OKLCH color space. 

Unlike traditional workflows that require editing each shade individually (e.g., Tailwind colors), this app samples colors from smooth gradients in OKLCH color space, resulting in smooth, harmonious color steps.
